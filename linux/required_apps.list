To install vmware ssl-vpn client:
 - log into https://staff-vpn.geoplace.co.uk and login with your AD credentials
 - Click on Full Access and download the phat client tar.gz
 - unzip and execute script ./install_linux_phat_client.sh. I recevied error NSS pkg not found, I modified the shell script to look for firefox in /usr/bin/firefox (it's there the error came from)

Problem - unable to share my screen with others in MS Teams
Solution - sudoedit /etc/gdm3/custom.conf and uncomment WaylandEnable=false, this disables Wayland (I do not know what wayland is yet!)
